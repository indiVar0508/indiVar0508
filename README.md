## Hi there, I am Indivar ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as Software Engineer
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python & golang
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate / participate on volunteering events.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Python / Reinforcement learning
- âœ¨ Fun fact: "73 is the 21st prime number . Its mirror, 37, is the 12th and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying 7 and 3, and in binary 73 is a palindrome, 1001001, which backwards is 1001001." if you caught that reference we are good friends !
